# Portfolio: My Personal Website

The goal of this project is simple: to showcase myself, my skills, and my experience.

## Core technologies

I chose to use [Astro](https://astro.build/) because I believe itâ€™s the most suitable framework for this type of project. As a static site generator with built-in support for rendering Markdown files, Astro offers excellent performance and SEO. The Markdown support allows me to easily add new content to the site.

For parts of the site that require reactivity, I used [Solid](https://www.solidjs.com/). Itâ€™s an excellent library for building reactive UIs, and I really appreciate how it utilizes signals. The developer experience (DX) is fantastic.

## User interface and design

The UI is built with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), a powerful library that simplifies styling. The design reflects my identity as a developer, using a monospace font throughout the application. Itâ€™s minimalistic and simple while maintaining a modern and informative feel.

## Deployment

This project is hosted on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), a fantastic service that allows me to deploy my site with a single click.
