# Portfolio. My personal website.

This project goal is simple - to showcase my skills and experience.

## Core technologies

I decided to use [Astro](https://astro.build/) as I think it is the most suitable framework for this type of project. It is a static site generator
and has built-in support for rendering Markdown files. Static site generation provideds greate performance and SEO while Markdown support
allows me to easily add new content to the site.

## UI

UI is built with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/). Again - it is a great library that simplifies styling and has great DX. The UI itself is built
so ot shows the fact that I am a developer. It uses monospace font thoughout the application and it's as minimalystic and simple as possible while still aims to be
modern and informative.
