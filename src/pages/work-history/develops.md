# JavaScript Developer at [DevelopsToday](https://develops.today/)

## TL;DR

I worked as a **JavaScript developer** on both frontend and backend in an outstaff company across various projects.

On the frontend, I worked extensively with **React** and its ecosystem (**Redux**, **react-router**, **react-query**, etc.),
as well as metaframeworks like **Next.js** and **Remix**.
I also developed mobile applications using **React Native**.

My frontend responsibilities spanned a broad range of tasks - from building user interfaces and integrating them with backend services,
to implementing business logic, testing, and deploying applications.

On the backend, I used **Node.js** with both **SQL** and **NoSQL** databases. In one project,
I worked with **AWS** and explored the serverless ecosystem and various AWS services.
I was responsible for building APIs and managing backend infrastructure.

Beyond technical tasks, I **onboarded new developers**, **managed projects**, and **handled client communications**.

## Projects I worked on

### Project #1

The project is a web application built with **React** and **Next.js** (using the pages router).
It is a platform that provides AI-assisted negotiations for users.

I worked here as a full-stack developer.

On the frontend, we used **TailwindCSS** and **shad/cn** for UI development.
Integration with the backend was managed using **react-query**.

The application employed **Supabase** with **TypeORM** for database management.
Initially, all backend logic was handled by Next.js API routes,
but it was later migrated (a responsibility of mine) to a separate **Node.js** server
with the **Express** framework to support web sockets (using **Socket.io**).

One of the main features is an AI-driven negotiation flow powered by OpenAI's ChatGPT,
which presented a unique challenge to implement correctly.
We used the **XState** state machine library to manage the negotiation flow
and trigger appropriate actions as the process progressed.

### Project #2

This project is a web application built with **Remix** and a **PostgreSQL** database managed by **Prisma** ORM.
It serves as a social networking platform focused on health issues, where users can create profiles, share their experiences,
and discuss health conditions to support others.

My primary role was frontend development, with some backend responsibilities as well.

One of the most challenging features was integrating posts and user data from Reddit.
This required extensive data transformation and normalization to ensure compatibility with the application's flow.

### Project #3

This was not a single project in particular but rather ongoing work with the company's clients as a full-stack developer.

I worked on a variety of small- to medium-sized projects, using **React** and related ecosystem libraries for the frontend,
with the backend powered by **Strapi** CMS and a **SQLite** database.

One of the most interesting features was a **GraphQL** API that provided a unified interface for all data sources.

### Project #4

The project is a mobile app built with **React Native** and **Expo**.
It provides a platform for users to manage their electric vehicles and other appliances.

I worked as a frontend developer, integrating the app with the backend. The business logic was implemented using **Redux**.

As the sole developer on the mobile app, I had the opportunity to contribute valuable ideas,
feedback, and suggestions. This included implementing a push notification system and improving the UX throughout the app.

### Project #5

The project is a platform for artists to help them distribute their music, sell merchandise, and grow their fanbase.

The project utilizes a **monorepo** approach,
including web applications built with **React** and **Redux** (the main application for artists and back office)
and additional applications built with **Next.js** (artist page and landing page) to provide better SEO.

On the backend, it uses **AWS** services and is built with **Node.js** and the **Serverless** framework.

A particularly interesting technology for me in this project was **Sanity CMS**, which powers the landing page.

One of the most interesting and challenging features I worked on was a service responsible for extracting lyrics from music files uploaded by users.
The solution leverages **AWS ECR** and the **OpenAI Whisper** model,
using a separate vocal track extracted by the **Deezer Spleeter** model to feed into the Whisper model.

A challenging task related to the frontend was implementing an artist page editor using a shared components approach.

## Non-technical responsibilities

I was responsible for onboarding new developers and providing them with the necessary resources and support at the start of their career in the company.
I also managed projects, including handling client comminications and assigning tasks to team members.

As DevelopsToday is an outstaff company, a great part of workflow is related to the passing interview with clients.
