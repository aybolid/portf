## Projects I worked on

### Project #1

This project is a platform for artists to help distribute music, sell merchandise, and grow their fanbase.

The project used a **monorepo** approach, with web applications built in **React** and **Redux** (for the main artist and back-office applications),
and **Next.js** applications (for the artist page and landing page) to enhance SEO.

The backend utilized **AWS** services and was built with **Node.js** using the **Serverless** framework.
A highlight of the project was working with **Sanity CMS** to manage the content for the landing page.

One unique feature involved a service for extracting lyrics from uploaded music files.
This was achieved using **AWS ECR**, **OpenAI Whisper**, and **Deezer Spleeter** for vocal separation, which then fed into the Whisper model.

On the frontend, implementing an artist page editor with shared components added an extra layer of challenge.

### Project #2

A web application with **React** and **Next.js** (using the pages router), offering AI-assisted negotiation features for users.

I worked as a full-stack developer, handling the frontend with **TailwindCSS** and **shad/cn** for UI development,
and using **TanStack Query** for backend integration.

The application utilized **Supabase** and **TypeORM** for database management. Initially, backend logic was handled by Next.js API routes,
which I later migrated to a standalone **Node.js** server with **Express** to support web sockets via **Socket.io**.

A core feature of the application was an AI-driven negotiation flow powered by OpenAI’s ChatGPT.
We managed this process using the **XState** state machine library to orchestrate actions throughout the negotiation.

### Project #3

I also contributed to a mobile app built with **React Native** and **Expo** that allows users to manage electric vehicles and other appliances.

As a frontend developer, I worked on backend integration and implemented business logic with **Redux**.
Acting as the sole mobile developer, I also influenced the UX design and contributed to the implementation of push notifications.

### Project #4

Another project was a social networking platform focused on health, built with **Remix** and **PostgreSQL**, using **Prisma** ORM.

My primary role was frontend development, with some backend responsibilities as well.
One complex feature involved integrating user and post data from Reddit into the platform,
which required extensive data transformation for compatibility.

### Project #5

This wasn’t really a single project; I worked as a full-stack developer on multiple small- to medium-sized projects,
primarily using **React** on the frontend. The backend relied on **Strapi** CMS and an **SQLite** database.

One noteworthy feature was a **GraphQL** API, which served as a unified interface for all data sources.

## Non-technical responsibilities

In addition to development, I was responsible for onboarding new developers, providing guidance, and offering resources.
I also managed project communications with clients and assigned tasks within the team.

As DevelopsToday is an outstaffing company, much of the workflow involves client interviews and related preparations.
