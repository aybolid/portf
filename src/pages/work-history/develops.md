# JavaScript Developer at [DevelopsToday](https://develops.today/)

### TL;DR

I worked as a JavaScript developer on both frontend and backend in an outstaff company across various projects.

On the frontend, I worked extensively with React and its ecosystem (Redux, react-router, react-query, etc.), as well as metaframeworks like Next.js and Remix.
I also developed mobile applications using React Native.

My frontend responsibilities spanned a broad range of tasks - from building user interfaces and integrating them with backend services,
to implementing business logic, testing, and deploying applications.

On the backend, I used Node.js with both SQL and NoSQL databases. In one project,
I worked with AWS and explored the serverless ecosystem and various AWS services.
I was responsible for building APIs and managing backend infrastructure.

Beyond technical tasks, I onboarded new developers, managed projects, and handled client communications.
