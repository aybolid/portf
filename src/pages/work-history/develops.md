# JavaScript Developer at [DevelopsToday](https://develops.today/)

## TL;DR

As a **JavaScript developer**, I worked on both frontend and backend in an outstaffing environment, participating in a variety of projects.

On the frontend, my main tools included **React** and its ecosystem (**Redux**, **react-router**, **react-query**, etc.),
along with frameworks like **Next.js** and **Remix**. Additionally, I developed mobile applications with **React Native**.

My frontend responsibilities ranged from building user interfaces
and integrating them with backend services to implementing business logic, testing, and deploying applications.

For backend development, I used **Node.js** and worked with both **SQL** and **NoSQL** databases.
In one project, I used **AWS** services and explored the serverless ecosystem. My backend role also included building APIs and managing backend infrastructure.

Beyond technical tasks, I contributed by **onboarding new developers**, **managing projects**, and **communicating with clients**.

## Projects I worked on

### Project #1

One project was a web application built with **React** and **Next.js** (using the pages router), providing AI-assisted negotiation features for users.

I worled as a full-stack developer. On the frontend using **TailwindCSS** and **shad/cn** for UI development,
with **react-query** for backend integration.

The application used **Supabase** and **TypeORM** for database management.
Initially, backend logic was handled by Next.js API routes,
which I later migrated to a standalone **Node.js** server with **Express** to support web sockets via **Socket.io**.

A core feature was an AI-driven negotiation flow powered by OpenAIâ€™s ChatGPT.
We managed this with the **XState** state machine library to orchestrate actions through the negotiation process.

### Project #2

Another project was a social networking platform, focused on health, built with **Remix** and **PostgreSQL** using **Prisma** ORM.

My primary role was frontend development, with some backend responsibilities as well.
One complex feature involved integrating user and post data from Reddit, which required extensive data transformation for compatibility.

### Project #3

In a broader ongoing project, I worked as a full-stack developer on multiple small- to medium-sized projects,
mainly using **React** on the frontend. The backend relied on **Strapi** CMS and a **SQLite** database.

One noteworthy feature was a **GraphQL** API that served as a unified interface for all data sources.

### Project #4

I also contributed to a mobile app built with **React Native** and **Expo** that lets users manage electric vehicles and other appliances.

As a frontend developer, I worked on backend integration, implementing the business logic with **Redux**.
Acting as the sole mobile developer, I also influenced UX design and contrubited by designing push notifications implementation.

### Project #5

Another interesting project was a platform for artists to help distribute music, sell merchandise, and grow their fanbase.

The project used a **monorepo** approach, with web applications built in **React** and **Redux** (main artist and back-office applications)
and **Next.js** applications (artist page and landing page) for SEO.

The backend used **AWS** services and was built with **Node.js** using the **Serverless** framework.
A highlight was working with **Sanity CMS** to manage the landing page content.

A unique feature involved a service for extracting lyrics from uploaded music files,
utilizing **AWS ECR**, **OpenAI Whisper**, and **Deezer Spleeter** for vocal separation, to feed into the Whisper model.

On the frontend, implementing an artist page editor with shared components added another layer of challenge.

## Non-technical responsibilities

In addition to development, I was responsible for onboarding new developers and offering guidance and resources.
I also managed project communications with clients and assigned tasks within the team.

As DevelopsToday is an outstaff company, much of the workflow involves client interviews and related preparations.

and I look forward to continuing to grow in the industry and tackling new challenges in the future.
