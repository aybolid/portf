## About Me

As youâ€™ve probably noticed, my name is Matviy Ivanov, and I am a web developer from Ukraine ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦.
Iâ€™m passionate about coding and creating solutions that make peopleâ€™s lives easier.
I constantly strive to improve my skills and expand my knowledge,
always seeking new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow.

## Proffesional Story

A while ago, I decided to explore the world of IT, starting with quality assurance (QA).
I completed an online course, but I quickly realized that finding bugs wasnâ€™t quite for me - I wanted to be the one creating them! (Just kidding... kind of ðŸ˜¬).

Curious about development, I built a simple website, and it completely amazed me.
That experience sparked my journey as a self-taught developer,
leading me to discover a career thatâ€™s both fascinating and incredibly rewarding.

Today, Iâ€™m thrilled that coding isnâ€™t just my profession but also my true passion.
Every skill Iâ€™ve gained and every project Iâ€™ve completed is a result of my hard work,
dedication, and relentless curiosity to learn and grow.

## Values and approach to work

1. **Simplicity and Minimalism**

    In both development and my personal life, I embrace simplicity and minimalism.
    I believe the simplest solution is often the bestâ€”itâ€™s easier to maintain, scale,
    and more enjoyable to use. Overengineering isnâ€™t my style; I prefer to create clean,
    efficient solutions that solve problems without unnecessary complexity.

2. **Continuous Learning**

    As a self-taught developer, I value the process of learning and improvement.
    I consistently strive to expand my skill set and stay updated with the latest technologies

3. **Attention to Detail**

    Whether writing code or designing a feature, I pay close attention to detail.
    I take pride in crafting solutions that are not only functional but also polished and reliable.

## Personal interests

Outside of coding (which Iâ€™d say is my main passion), I have a few other hobbies.
I love playing the electric guitar, especially rock music. My favorite band is Black Sabbath,
and I can play nearly all their songs from the Ozzy Osbourne era.

Iâ€™m also a huge fan of Formula 1 racing. It might seem surprising since Iâ€™m not particularly into cars,
but the pinnacle of motorsport, with its speed and precision, is absolutely breathtaking to me.
