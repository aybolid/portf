## About me

My name is Matviy Ivanov, and I'm a software engineer from Ukraine ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¦.
I'm passionate about building user-friendly and efficient software solutions.

## Proffesional story

Some time ago, I decided to explore IT, and I started by trying out quality assurance (QA).
I completed a few courses, but I soon realized that finding bugs wasnâ€™t quite for me - I wanted to be the one creating them! (Thatâ€™s a joke, of course ðŸ˜¬).
So, I tried building a simple website, and it amazed me. From there, I dove into the developer role and discovered a truly fascinating and rewarding career.

Today, I'm thrilled that coding is not only my career but also a true passion.

## Values and Approach to Work

Not only in development but also in my personal life, I embrace simplicity and minimalism.
The simpler solution is often the best one. It's easier to maintain, scale, and more enjoyable to use.

Overengineering is not my thing. I'm not a fan of overcomplicating things, and I try to avoid it whenever possible.

## Personal interests

Outside of coding, I have a few other hobbies (although Iâ€™d say coding is my main one).
I love playing electric guitar - especially rock music. My favorite band is Black Sabbath,
and I can play nearly all their songs from the Ozzy Osbourne era.

And last but not least, Iâ€™m a huge fan of Formula 1 racing.
It might seem strange since Iâ€™m not particularly into cars,
but the pinnacle of motorsport and it's speed is breathtaking to me.
